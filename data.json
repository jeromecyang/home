      "type": "Visualization",
      "description": "Air pollution mapping requires interpolation from point data. Instead of obtaining observations from existing monitoring stations, in this project we mapped air pollution from scratch - that is, we designed a monitoring network where the distribution of stations is optimized, went into the field to collect first-hand data, and explored the best way to visualize the data. Works included spatial optimization algorithm, experiment design, field particulate matter measurement, and visualization. This project, which was proposed and coordinated by me, ultimately involved a interdisciplinary and collaborative effort of two professors and four graduate students with background in GIS, environmental science, physics, etc. It was awarded by Geller's Research Grant at Clark University."

      "description": "AfricaMap is an open-source web mapping platform designated for archiving, visualizing and integrating geospatial statistics particularly for Africa. One can easily find statistics from various organizations and governments, but how do we fit them together in one single platform? As a GIS analyst at Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA), Harvard University, I worked with Prof. Suzanne Blier to retrieve statistics from various sources, and explored the options to make these number \"visible\" on map. To handle data in various formats and qualities, I employed my fimilarity with data syntax and skills in programming for text processing to handle the data effectively and accurately. This is an ongoing project and all results are available at http://worldmap.harvard.edu/africamap."

      "type": "Visualization",
      "description": "Eelgrass (<i>Zostera</i>) is an vital species in coastal ecosystems. It provides nutritions for many shallow ocean animals, and consequently sustains the fishery economy in the state of Maine. The goal of eelgrass mapping is to investigate, monitor and visualize eelgrass distribution. Before entering the field, potential eelgrass patches were identified on low-tide aerial imagery and digitized in ArcGIS. While in the field, we drove a boat, navigated by ArcPad to visit every location we identified, and recorded the actual condition with notes, GPS tracklogs, photos and videos. After the field work, the data collected were summarized and released as public-accessible information in a web mapping application."

      "description": "Internet provides an effective way for multiple people to contribute geospatial data to one database. I participated in two crowd-sourcing GIS projects. <b>Maine Elver Map</b> was designed for marine patrol officers to report locations where illegal harvesting of elvers (young eels) were found. It successfully gathered 85 locations reported by about 10 officers. It employed Google Maps API and Google Fusion Table to provide a user interface and a publicly accessible database. Any input data was immediately reviewed by administrators via email to ensure the quality of the data. <b>QianTang River Map</b> was built to gather succeptible water pollution activities along the river. This project was initiated by Green Zhejiang, an environmental protection NGO in China. I worked as the primary technical lead to implement the system. Built upon Ushahidi's CrowdMap platform, it leverages open-source tools to provide a zero-cost and easy-to-use solution to the NGO's need for crowd-sourcing."

These scenes were made by scanning and georeferencing maps from the project plans, retrieving Google's sattelite imagery, overlaying data with digital terrain model (DTM) in ArcScene, and post-export editing with Corel PhotoImpact.",
